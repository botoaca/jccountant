# Jccountant

Jccountant is a little project I made to keep my transactions in a JSON database. \
To use Jccountant, run the `make` command (provided you have make installed) \
and run the `build/output.exe` file. It will ask you to choose an action. \
The actions are really straight-forward, so you should have no issue using them.
